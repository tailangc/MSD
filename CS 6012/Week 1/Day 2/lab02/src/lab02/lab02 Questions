1. On your computer, how many times per second does the millisecond timer update?
Its varing from 998 to 1002 times.

2. Is it possible to determine how many times per second the nanosecond timer updates? If so, how many? If not, why not?
It is not possible.

3. Judging by experiment 4, how long does it appear to take to compute System.nanoTime()?
About 41 nanoseconds

4. Estimate the precision of your answer above (+/- how many nanoseconds?)
+/- 1 nano second

5. How long does it take to compute the square root of the numbers 1 through 10?
7083 nanoseconds.

6. Estimate the precision of your answer above (+/- how many nanoseconds?)
+/- 100 nanoseconds

7. If you repeat the square root test 100x as many times, does the precision improve?
The precission improves to about 4 nano seconds

8. How could you improve the results (get a more accurate estimate of elapsed time)?
repeat the run for more times
