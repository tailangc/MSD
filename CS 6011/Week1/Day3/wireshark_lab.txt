Can you understand the output from Wireshark?
You'll observe the initial HTTP request and the corresponding redirect. Then you'll see the start of a TLS handshake (the protocol behind HTTPS). This involves the client hello, server hello, key exchange, etc.
The subsequent HTTPS traffic is encrypted. So, while you can see the packet details in Wireshark, you won't be able to understand the actual content (like the HTTP request details) unless you have the necessary keys to decrypt the traffic.

 Why can you only read the first couple of messages?
This is due to the encryption of HTTPS. Once the TLS handshake is complete, the actual data exchanged between the client and server (including HTTP requests and responses) is encrypted. You'd see the encrypted packets in Wireshark but won't be able to read the content without decryption.
